Description: This packages is a suit of functions to perform association analysis of
             mosaic LOY and quantitative or continuous outcomes. It uses SNP array data in pennCNV
             format (e.g. having snp_name, chromosome, position, LRR, BAF and genotype). There are             
             functions to perform quality control of samples, functions to process raw data and extract
             the LRR and BAF information of required genomic regions, and a function to perform 
             calling based on Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution that properly fits LRR data.
