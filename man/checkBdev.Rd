\arguments{
\item{object}{A LOY class object to check the LOY and uncertain samples or a single file path (APT platform and MAD platform), a vector of 
file paths (MAD platform) or a MAD rawData folder path containing files 
ready to be processed with MAD (MAD platform).}

\item{rsCol}{The position of the column with the SNP identifier.}

\item{ChrCol}{The position of the column with the Chromosome field.}

\item{PosCol}{The position of the column with the Position field.}

\item{LRRCol}{The position of the column with the LRR field.}

\item{BAFCol}{The position of the column with the BAF field.}

\item{top}{Superior treshold to consider an heterozygous allele. By default is set to 0.85.}

\item{bot}{Inferior treshold to consider an heterozygous allele. By default is set to 0.15.}

\item{trim}{trim the fraction (0 to 0.5) of probes to be trimmed when summaryzing LRR.}

\item{mc.cores}{The number of cores used to perform the function. By default 
is set to 1.}

\item{quiet}{Should the function not inform about the status of the process. 
By default is FALSE.}

\item{hg}{Human genome build version. By default set to "GRCh38".}

\item{pval.sig}{p-value treshold to be used in the classification test. By default is set to 0.05.}

\item{bdev.threshold}{bdev threshold to determine if there is BAF split significant enough to call an altered region. By default is set to 0.05.}

\item{...}{Other parameters.}
}
\value{
A MADloyBdev object that contains the Bdev values for the two PAR regions for all the files 
  analyzed.
}
\description{
checkBdev checks the B deviation values of all the MAD files specified or in
a path to check for possible Loss of Y events. The Bdev is computed by default for the 
PAR1 and PAR2 regions. The minimum cellularity detected in losses is 26% (bdev.threshold=0.06) by default. Lower values of bdev.threshold can increase
the detection of false positives.
