\usage{
checkSex(
  files,
  rsCol = 1,
  ChrCol = 2,
  PosCol = 3,
  LRRCol = 4,
  mc.cores,
  trim = 0.2,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A single file path (APT platform and MAD platform), a vector of 
file paths (MAD platform) or a MAD rawData folder path containing files 
ready to be processed with MAD (MAD platform).}

\item{rsCol}{The position of the column with the SNP identifier.}

\item{ChrCol}{The position of the column with the Chromosome field.}

\item{PosCol}{The position of the column with the Position field.}

\item{LRRCol}{The position of the column with the LRR identifier.}

\item{mc.cores}{The number of cores used to perform the function. By default 
is set to 1.}

\item{trim}{the fraction (0 to 0.5) of probes to be trimmed when summaryzing LRR. 
This argument tries to control the effect of having CNVs across genome. Default is 0.2.}

\item{quiet}{Should the function not inform about the status of the process. 
By default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A checkSex object that contains the trimmed mean LRR in chrX and chrY in
  the analyzed samples, and its classification as males and females in the class variableinside the object.
